# Welcome
## You push into this codebase with furious interest
### You open your first file and trying to understand author's intentions
#### You get relinked to a thousand interfaces and a code covered with tailwind scary makings
##### This code is so malfunctioning, Typescript isnt always here
###### You dive deeper and look at these poor implementations even without redux
###### User is stored in local storage so that any bastard would get your information
###### Pages are unresponsive because this is nextjs WITHOUT ANY FUCKING SERVER SIDE RENDERING
###### You look at the amount of components and understand that there should be 2 times more
###### You finally find this beautiful crappy reusable form design with a thousand crotches to work
###### To understand moon animation, youd rather buy yourself a new brain
###### Recursive comment querying via graphql destroy your sense of sanity
###### This bastard uses firebase library only for image storing???????????
###### There is not even a chat feature lol talk via email
###### I hope author gets 1000 refusals for job offers (lol he got that, be sure)
